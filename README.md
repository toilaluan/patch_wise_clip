# Local Alignment Between Text and Image Features

## Problem Statement

Traditional CLIP models face an inherent architectural mismatch: image encoders produce a fixed number of patch features (e.g., 49 patches for a 7Ã—7 grid), while text encoders generate variable-length token sequences. This asymmetry limits the model's ability to establish fine-grained correspondences between specific text semantics and visual regions.

## Proposed Solution

We propose enhancing CLIP with **local alignment** capabilities that enable correspondence between semantic text components and spatial image regions, while maintaining the global text-image alignment that makes CLIP effective. We finally aim to find better pretrained text encoders in Text-to-Image or related multimodal tasks.


### Core Innovation: Text Feature Compression Module

The key contribution is a learnable compression module that transforms variable-length text features into a fixed-size representation matching the spatial dimensions of image patches:

$$
\mathbf{T} = \text{TextEncoder}(\text) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I} = \text{ImageEncoder}(\text{image}) \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times d}
$$

$$
\mathbf{T}_{compressed} = \text{CompressionModule}(\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{R}) \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times d}
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{T}$ represents variable-length text features ($N$ tokens)
- $\mathbf{I}$ represents fixed-size image patch features ($M$ patches)
- $\mathbf{R}$ are learnable register tokens that serve as compression anchors
- $\mathbf{T}_{compressed}$ matches the spatial structure of image patches

### Architecture Details

**Compression Module Design:**
- Uses cross-attention mechanism with learnable register tokens
- Register tokens act as semantic "slots" that aggregate relevant text information
- Preserves semantic meaning while enforcing spatial correspondence
- Enables gradient flow back to text encoder for end-to-end training

**Multi-Level Objective Function:**
$$
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \lambda_{global} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{global} + \lambda_{local} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{local}
$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_{global}$: Standard CLIP contrastive loss on pooled features
- $\mathcal{L}_{local}$: Patch-wise alignment loss between compressed text features and image patches
- $\lambda_{global}$, $\lambda_{local}$: Balancing hyperparameters

### Local Alignment Loss

The local alignment loss encourages correspondence between compressed text features and relevant image regions:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{local} = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \text{CrossEntropy}(\text{sim}(\mathbf{T}_{compressed}^{(i)}, \mathbf{I}^{(i)}))
$$

This creates a spatial attention mechanism that learns which text semantics correspond to which image regions.

## Expected Benefits

1. **Fine-grained Understanding**: Model learns associations between text phrases and visual regions
2. **Improved Localization**: Better performance on tasks requiring spatial reasoning
3. **Semantic Grounding**: Explicit alignment between language concepts and visual elements
4. **Maintained Global Performance**: Preserves CLIP's strong global alignment capabilities

## Applications

- **Visual Question Answering**: Better understanding of spatial relationships
- **Image Captioning**: More accurate description of object locations and interactions
- **Object Detection**: Improved text-to-region correspondence
- **Multimodal Retrieval**: Enhanced fine-grained matching capabilities

This approach extends CLIP's capabilities from global text-image matching to include local semantic-spatial correspondence, enabling more nuanced multimodal understanding.
